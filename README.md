## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

Through this case study, we learned how to check for part compatibility, such as checking if the processor is compatible with the motherboard or if the case fans fit inside the chassis. We also learned which stores have cheaper parts by comparing prices across different vendors. Additionally, we discovered the overclock capabilities of specific Intel chipsets and Z-series motherboards. Lastly, we gained experience with building around a set budget, having to consider tradeoffs between performance and price.
